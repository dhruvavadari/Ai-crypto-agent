This is the initial python function. Do not change the params. Given the context, use the right dataframes.
```python
# TODO import all the dependencies required
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze the data, using the provided dataframes (`dfs`).
    1. Prepare: Preprocessing and cleaning data if necessary
    2. Process: Manipulating data for analysis (grouping, filtering, aggregating, etc.)
    3. Analyze: Conducting the actual analysis (if the user asks to plot a chart you must save it as an image in temp_chart.png and not show the chart.)
    If the user requests to create a chart, utilize the Python matplotlib library to generate high-quality graphics that will be saved directly to a file.
    At the end, return a dictionary of:
    - type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot")
    - value (can be a string, a dataframe or the path of the plot, NOT a dictionary)
    Examples: 
        { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." }
        or
        { "type": "number", "value": 125 }
        or
        { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) }
        or
        { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }
    """
```

Take a deep breath and reason step-by-step. Act as a senior data analyst.
In the answer, you must never write the "technical" names of the tables.
Based on the last message in the conversation:
- return the updated analyze_data function wrapped within ```python ```
